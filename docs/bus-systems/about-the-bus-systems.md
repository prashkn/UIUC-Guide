# About the Bus Systems

I see a lot of freshman avoid using the bus systems because they have never used public transit before. No shame in that; if you are from a suburban area, it's likely that you never had a good bus system.

**Use the buses.** The bus system at UIUC is really good. It used to be a bit more frequent in the past, but nevertheless it is still good. There is a very good chance that wherever you are going, the bus can take you there faster.
