# The Questions You're Afraid to Ask

This is a no judgement zone üëç

### Are there rules for how to get on the bus?

If you are on/near campus, you can get on at any of the bus doors.

If you are outside of campus (i.e. Illinois terminal, a popular off-campus bus stop), you will need to board at the front of the bus, and show the bus driver your i-Card.

### How do I signal that I need to get off at the next stop?

There are yellow wires running alongside the bus. Simply **pull on the wire when you want to get off at the next stop**.

### How do I know which bus to take?

### How do I get to a bus stop?

### How often to buses run?
