# UIUC Guide Intro

## Who is this guide for

This guide is intended for **students that are new to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign** and want to learn a bit more about UIUC before choosing to accept the offer to attend.

There may be some portions that are **a bit more geared towards the Computer Science and/or the out of state experience** here. If you are not a out of state CS student, you'll probably skip a few things; sorry.

## Why I created this guide

If you were like me, this is probably your first time moving to a new state without family/friends nearby. No one from my high school attended UIUC during my year.

**You have to make an active effort to learn about some resources that a lot of others may already know** just by having family or friends that went here before. **I want to make all these resources known** before you start attending.

## Feedback

If you are a current or previous UIUC student, please feel free to add any changes! I'm especially looking for those who come from different backgrounds (different majors, in state, international, gender) to add their experiences and knowledge.

There should be an `Edit this page` link below, that allows you to request any changes you want.
